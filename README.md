Readme files for byurl, byfile, and bycam are in their respective directoriea. 
The issue with the sample url is it refreshed. I tried 2 different streams, one local and one at the state. Both refreshed and local  no longer does autoplay.

Try this:
1. scrape the URL by connecting. Right click. Copy image link. Use that link.
2. Take video of cars. Name it video1.mp4   Place in root directory.
3. Use your desktop or picam to capture video.
